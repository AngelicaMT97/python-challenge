# PyBank Financial Analysis

This repository contains a Python script for financial analysis based on a dataset of monthly profits and losses. The script calculates various financial metrics and outputs the results to both the terminal and a text file.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your machine.

#### Usage

The main.py script reads a CSV file containing monthly profit and loss data and performs the following calculations:

> Total number of months included in the dataset
> Net total amount of profits and losses over the entire period
> Changes in profits and losses over the entire period, along with the average change
> Greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
> Greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
> The results are displayed in the terminal and saved to a text file (Analysis.txt)

Customization
If your CSV file is located in a different directory, update the csv_path variable in the script accordingly. Similarly, adjust the output_path variable if you want the output text file in a different location.
